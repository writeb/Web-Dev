string.\n * @param definitions  An animation definition object, containing an array of\n * [`state()`](api/animations/state) and `transition()` declarations.\n *\n * @return An object that encapsulates the trigger data.\n *\n * @usageNotes\n * Define an animation trigger in the `animations` section of `@Component` metadata.\n * In the template, reference the trigger by name and bind it to a trigger expression that\n * evaluates to a defined animation state, using the following format:\n *\n * `[@triggerName]=\"expression\"`\n *\n * Animation trigger bindings convert all values to strings, and then match the\n * previous and current values against any linked transitions.\n * Booleans can be specified as `1` or `true` and `0` or `false`.\n *\n * ### Usage Example\n *\n * The following example creates an animation trigger reference based on the provided\n * name value.\n * The provided animation value is expected to be an array consisting of state and\n * transition declarations.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * @Component({\n *   selector: \"my-component\",\n *   templateUrl: \"my-component-tpl.html\",\n *   animations: [\n *     trigger(\"myAnimationTrigger\", [\n *       state(...),\n *       state(...),\n *       transition(...),\n *       transition(...)\n *     ])\n *   ]\n * })\n * class MyComponent {\n *   myStatusExp = \"something\";\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * The template associated with this component makes use of the defined trigger\n * by binding to an element within its template code.\n *\n * ```html\n * <!-- somewhere inside of my-component-tpl.html -->\n * <div [@myAnimationTrigger]=\"myStatusExp\">...</div>\n * ```\n *\n * ### Using an inline function\n * The `transition` animation method also supports reading an inline function which can decide\n * if its associated animation should be run.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // this method is run each time the `myAnimationTrigger` trigger value changes.\n * function myInlineMatcherFn(fromState: string, toState: string, element: any, params: {[key:\n string]: any}): boolean {\n *   // notice that `element` and `params` are also available here\n *   return toState == 'yes-please-animate';\n * }\n *\n * @Component({\n *   selector: 'my-component',\n *   templateUrl: 'my-component-tpl.html',\n *   animations: [\n *     trigger('myAnimationTrigger', [\n *       transition(myInlineMatcherFn, [\n *         // the animation sequence code\n *       ]),\n *     ])\n *   ]\n * })\n * class MyComponent {\n *   myStatusExp = \"yes-please-animate\";\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * ### Disabling Animations\n * When true, the special animation control binding `@.disabled` binding prevents\n * all animations from rendering.\n * Place the  `@.disabled` binding on an element to disable\n * animations on the element itself, as well as any inner animation triggers\n * within the element.\n *\n * The following example shows how to use this feature:\n *\n * ```typescript\n * @Component({\n *   selector: 'my-component',\n *   template: `\n *     <div [@.disabled]=\"isDisabled\">\n *       <div [@childAnimation]=\"exp\"></div>\n *     </div>\n *   `,\n *   animations: [\n *     trigger(\"childAnimation\", [\n *       // ...\n *     ])\n *   ]\n * })\n * class MyComponent {\n *   isDisabled = true;\n *   exp = '...';\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * When `@.disabled` is true, it prevents the `@childAnimation` trigger from animating,\n * along with any inner animations.\n *\n * ### Disable animations application-wide\n * When an area of the template is set to have animations disabled,\n * **all** inner components have their animations disabled as well.\n * This means that you can disable all animations for an app\n * by placing a host binding set on `@.disabled` on the topmost Angular component.\n *\n * ```typescript\n * import {Component, HostBinding} from '@angular/core';\n *\n * @Component({\n *   selector: 'app-component',\n *   templateUrl: 'app.component.html',\n * })\n * class AppComponent {\n *   @HostBinding('@.disabled')\n *   public animationsDisabled = true;\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * ### Overriding disablement of inner animations\n * Despite inner animations being disabled, a parent animation can `query()`\n * for inner elements located in disabled areas of the template and still animate\n * them if needed. This is also the case for when a sub animation is\n * queried by a parent and then later animated using `animateChild()`.\n *\n * ### Detecting when an animation is disabled\n * If a region of the DOM (or the entire application) has its animations disabled, the animation\n * trigger callbacks still fire, but for zero seconds. When the callback fires, it provides\n * an instance of an `AnimationEvent`. If animations are disabled,\n * the `.disabled` flag on the event is true.\n *\n * @publicApi\n */\nexport function trigger(name: string, definitions: AnimationMetadata[]): AnimationTriggerMetadata {\n  return {type: AnimationMetadataType.Trigger, name, definitions, options: {}};\n}\n\n/**\n * Defines an animation step that combines styling information with timing information.\n *\n * @param timings Sets `AnimateTimings` for the parent animation.\n * A string in the format \"duration [delay] [easing]\".\n *  - Duration and delay are expressed as a number and optional time unit,\n * such as \"1s\" or \"10ms\" for one second and 10 milliseconds, respectively.\n * The default unit is milliseconds.\n *  - The easing value controls how the animation accelerates and decelerates\n * during its runtime.
