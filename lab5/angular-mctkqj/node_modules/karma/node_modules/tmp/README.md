## About

This is a [widely used library][2] to create temporary files and directories
in a [node.js][1] environment.

Tmp offers both an asynchronous and a synchronous API. For all API calls, all
the parameters are optional. There also exists a promisified version of the
API, see [tmp-promise][5].

Tmp uses crypto for determining random file names, or, when using templates,
a six letter random identifier. And just in case that you do not have that much
entropy left on your system, Tmp will fall back to pseudo random numbers.

You can set whether you want to remove the temporary file on process exit or
not.

If you do not want to store your temporary directories and files in the
standard OS temporary directory, then you are free to override that as well.

## An Important Note on Compatibility

See the [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) for more information.

### Version 0.1.0

Since version 0.1.0, all support for node versions < 0.10.0 has been dropped.

Most importantly, any support for earlier versions of node-tmp was also dropped.

If you still require node versions < 0.10.0, then you must limit your node-tmp
dependency to versions below 0.1.0.

### Version 0.0.33

Since version 0.0.33, all support for node versions < 0.8 has been dropped.

If you still require node version 0.8, then you must limit your node-tmp
dependency to version 0.0.33.

For node versions < 0.8 you must limit your node-tmp dependency to
versions < 0.0.33.

## How to install

```bash
npm install tmp
```

## Usage

Please also check [API docs][4].

### Asynchronous file creation

Simple temporary file creation, the file will be closed and unlinked on process exit.

```javascript
const tmp = require('tmp');

tmp.file(function _tempFileCreated(err, path, fd, cleanupCallback) {
  if (err) throw err;

  console.log('File: ', path);
  console.log('Filedescriptor: ', fd);
  
  // If we don't need the file anymore we could manually call the cleanupCallback
  // But that is not necessary if we didn't pass the keep option because the library
  // will clean after itself.
  cleanupCallback();
});
```

### Synchronous file creation

A synchronous version of the above.

```javascript
const tmp = require('tmp');

const tmpobj = tmp.fileSync();
console.log('File: ', tmpobj.name);
console.log('Filedescriptor: ', tmpobj.fd);
  
// If we don't need the file anymore we could manually call the removeCallback
// But that is not necessary if we didn't pass the keep option because the library
// will clean after itself.
tmpobj.removeCallback();
```

Note that this might throw an exception if either the maximum limit of retries
for creating a temporary name fails, or, in case that you do not have the permission
to write to the directory where the temporary file should be created in.

### Asynchronous directory creation

Simple temporary directory creation, it will be removed on process exit.

If the directory still contains items on process exit, then it won't be removed.

```javascript
const tmp = require('tmp');

tmp.dir(function _tempDirCreated(err, path, cleanupCallback) {
  if (err) throw err;

  console.log('Dir: ', path);
  
  // Manual cleanup
  cleanupCallback();
});
```

If you want to cleanup the directory even when there are entries in it, then
you can pass the `unsafeCleanup` option when creating it.

### Synchronous directory creation

A synchronous version of the above.

```javascript
const tmp = require('tmp');

const tmpobj = tmp.dirSync();
console.log('Dir: ', tmpobj.name);
// Manual cleanup
tmpo
