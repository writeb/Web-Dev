        </h2>
        <p class="background">Ever since the age of 8 I dreamed of going to Barcelona, <br>Spain just so I can go see my favorite professional soccer team play which is FC Barcelona.<br> I was so eager to go I could almost hear the sound of the ball swooshing through the air or it hitting the cleats of the player, <br>but the most I could imagine is the crowd going wild and crying with joy as a goal is been scored.</p>

            <li class="background">It was then in mid-July were my parents surprised me that we were going to Spain for a family vacation.</li>
            <li class="background">As soon as I heard we were going to Spain I couldn't believe it my heart sank and I jumped up and down with excitement. <br>
                It was back in the year 2012 I was just 14 years old about to enter my ninth grade year. The plane was set to leave on July 28. <br>
                As the day came that I was supposed to leave I started packing, I couldn't help but to tell my friends where I was going</li>
            <li class="background">Finally the day came as I boarded the plane I waved good bye to my aunt who dropped us off at the airport. <br>
                As the plane took off I knew it would be a long flight so I fell asleep, after 5 hours of sleeping I woke up and we barley landed.<br>
                 I looked out the window and it was magnificent as I boarded off the plane everything was In Spanish the good thing is that in fluent <br>
                 in Spanish except for some words I didn't really understand but anyways as we left the airport we went to a local bank to get our U.</li>
